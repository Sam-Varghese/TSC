      Do not expose the test runner as a new core module (revert it before
      v18.0.0 is released, the test runner can be reintroduced later by exposing
      it on an existing core module).

# See email chain for more information.
# TL;DR is that a new test runner module has landed on `master` only available as `node:test`, while the prefix-less version can still refer to a userland module named `test`. `test` name is already used on the npm public registry by an unrelated package, while `test_runner` is not used and npm doesn't allow packages to be published with this name.
# Whatever the result of this vote is, the plan is to apply it before the v18.x semver cutoff which is next Tuesday (2022-04-12).
